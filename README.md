# Conway's Game of Life

This was a personal project I made after learning about Conway's Game of Life in an Artifical Intelligence class during my junior year (2022) at Florida Polytechnic University. I made it to practice using the C language.

In contrast to some versions of Conway's Game of Life, mine is simpler: the game-field is a finite space and the elements wrap-around when they go outside the borders.
